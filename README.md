=====CS290 Algorithms Final Project=====  
This project is a collaboration between Matt Jogodnik, Vikram Ruppa-Kasani,  
Pranav Sharma, and Shubham Joshi and submitted as a final project for CS290  
Algorithms Fall 2020 taught by Dr. Brandon Fain.

Research Question: How can match-making algorithm(s) be applied to internship-student  
matching to centralize and declutter the process as well as improve student outcomes.

**V1:** First commit: Matt Jogodnik - created datasets to test the match-making  
algorithm. Consists of the top 50 Fortune 500 companies. Each one is randomized to  
have a capacity between 12 and 48. These capacities are summed to arrive at the number  
of applicants. Each applicant's list of preferences is randomized amongst the 50 companies  
and each company's preference list is randomized amonst the sum total of capacities applicants.
