=====CS290 Algorithms Final Project=====  
This project is a collaboration between Matt Jogodnik, Vikram Ruppa-Kasani,  
Pranav Sharma, and Shubham Joshi and submitted as a final project for CS290  
Algorithms Fall 2020 taught by Dr. Brandon Fain.

Research Question: How can match-making algorithm(s) be applied to internship-student  
matching to centralize and declutter the process, as well as improve student outcomes?

Included:
Random Data generation scripts for student records and collegiate admission critera

# Gale-Shapley algorithm
The Galeâ€“Shapley algorithm (also known as the deferred acceptance algorithm) is an algorithm for finding a solution to the stable matching problem, named for David Gale and Lloyd Shapley who had described it as solving both the college admission problem and the stable marriage problem. It takes polynomial time, and the time is linear in the size of the input to the algorithm. It is a truthful mechanism from the point of view of the proposing participants, for whom the solution will always be optimal. Herein, we modified
